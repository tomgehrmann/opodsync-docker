# opodsync-docker

Automated container image builds for [oPodSync](https://github.com/kd2org/opodsync), a gPodder API compatible server previously known as Micro GPodder Server.

## Installation

> [!warning]
> Do **not** use this image in an untrusted environment! The image uses the php development server.

A compose file is provided.

```yaml:compose.yaml
services:
  opodsync:
    container_name: opodsync
    image: ghcr.io/tomgehrmann/opodsync:latest
    restart: on-failure:5
    user: ${PUID:-1000}:${PGID:-1000}
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges
      # - "apparmor=docker-opodsync" # optional hardening with AppArmor
    # read_only: true # needs evaluation: can't login if enabled
    mem_limit: 500MB
    cpus: 0.25
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/server/data:rw

```

### Notes

* Adjust the values to suit your setup.
* The user of the application has the UID/GID `1000` by default. If you want to use another user, you need to define this explicitly in the compose file. In any case, be aware of file permissions.

## Contributions and Maintenance
The builds are fully automated, I use them myself, but I don't actively monitor the health of the service.
Contributions are welcome, but I cannot promise timely replies.
